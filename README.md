# Advanced Stock Management System with Qt 6.5 and C++

## Introduction
This GUI application was an assignment for an Advanced Programming Course, showcasing the use of Qt 6.5 and C++ for managing stock in a small corner store. It features my approach at implementation of design patterns and XML data storage for inventory management.

## Features
- Manage two types of stock: confectionery and reading material.
- Factory Method design pattern for object creation.
- Singleton design pattern for managing a centralized stock list.
- Data persistence using QXMLStreamWriter.

Step 4: Click the "Extract" button to start the extraction process. Once it's done, you can open the destination folder to access the extracted files.
Step 5: Open QtCreator and click on 'Open Project'
Step 6: Navigate to the extracted file named 'Assignment2Q3' and locate the file called 'CMakeLists'
Step 7: Click on 'CMakeLists' file and click 'Open'
Step 8: The project should open up on QtCreator

### Post Installation and Setup
Step 1: After opening the project click on the Hammer button in the bottom left of the application to bulid the project.
Step 2: After clicking on the Hammer to bulid the project you can now Run the project by clicking on the play button.
